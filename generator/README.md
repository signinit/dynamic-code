# ⬛️ Generator

A Generator is push based.  
That means by subscribing to the `value` attribute each time there is a change the result is recompiled.  
This is achieved using rxjs which might be worth looking into if you want to use the generators.

Check out [Sample 4](../samples/sample-4.md) which uses a `Generator` in code.
