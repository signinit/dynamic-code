# Hybrid Generatable

A Hybrid Generatable extends the Generatable so it is also pull based, but it can not only generate code but also compute or generate the value the code represents.  
This can be achieved by calling `generateValue()`.


Check out [Sample 2](../samples/sample-2.md) which uses a `HybridGeneratable` in code.
