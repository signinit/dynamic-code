# ⚫️ Hybrid Generator

A Hybrid Generator extends the Generator so it is also push based, but it can not only automtically generate code but also compute the value the code represents.  
Getting the current value can be achieved by subscibring to the `value`.


Check out [Sample 5](../samples/sample-5.md) which uses a `HybridGenerator` in code.
